# flask-backend-project 

build a social media application that allows users to post messages and
"like" other users' messages. Main task is to build the backend API for the application
using Flask and PostgreSQL. The API allow users to:
1. Post a new message
2. View a list of all messages, with the most recent messages first
3. Like a message by clicking a button
4. View the total number of likes for each message
5. Created a PostgreSQL table to store messages, and a separate table
to store likes. Used Flask to build the API for creating and querying
messages and likes. Used PostgreSQL triggers to automatically
update the "likes" count for a message whenever a new like is added or
removed.
